| ### Berdan Hirli<br><br>About myself I am kurdish / turkish and I love watching football, I am a big Chelsea fan, even though I come from North London. Hopefully throughout my time in City I can meet the majority of the people in Computer Science. Other than that I have already programmed and did A Level Computer Science where I learned the language Python and databases, and I believe that Python is better as its simpler and easier to understand compared to Java, it is also getting more popular. |     |

| ### Bootcamp 2021: Generative Art<br><br>My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created Random Generative scene in which I made a class called Particle, which allows me to make random art using lines randomly generated. Then I created an array which will hold these lines when I create a loop to generate these lines, an array with a capacity of 500 was initialised which allowed 500 different lines to be randomly generated. I also used if statements so that these lines would go in random directions. Variables were used to determine these random positions.<br><br>Check out the code on Github: [https://github.com/BerdanH/Bootcamp_Project](https://github.com/BerdanH/Bootcamp_Project) | [Watch a video of the project](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/f4feb140-1eb2-4cc1-834c-acab2bd3005e) |     |
